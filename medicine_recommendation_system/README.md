# Medicine Information Recommendation System

An AI-powered medicine recommendation system that helps users find appropriate medications based on their symptoms using natural language processing and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technologies.

## Problem Statement
Patients often struggle to find reliable medicine information for their symptoms, leading to confusion and inappropriate self-medication. Traditional internet searches return unreliable results, while medical databases are too technical for general users.

## Solution
A sophisticated RAG-based system that provides accurate, comprehensive medicine information from a curated dataset of 11,000+ medications, with multi-agent AI architecture ensuring quality and accuracy.

## Dataset
- **Medicine Database**: 11,000+ medications with comprehensive information
- **Features**: Medicine name, composition, uses, side effects, manufacturer, reviews, images
- **Format**: Structured JSON with semantic search capabilities

## System Architecture

### Multi-Agent Framework
The system employs four specialized AI agents working in sequence:

1. **Grammar Corrector Agent**
   - Fixes spelling and grammar errors in user input
   - Uses Gramformer model for natural language correction
   - Ensures clear communication before processing

2. **Medicine Finder Agent**
   - Retrieves relevant medicines from vector database
   - Falls back to PubMed for additional medical literature
   - Uses semantic similarity search with HuggingFace embeddings

3. **Answer Generator Agent**
   - Converts structured data into user-friendly summaries
   - Generates natural language explanations
   - Maintains conversation context with memory

4. **Hallucination Checker Agent**
   - Validates generated content against source data
   - Detects and corrects unsupported claims
   - Ensures factual accuracy and reliability

### Technical Components

#### Retrieval System
- **Vector Database**: Chroma with HuggingFace embeddings
- **Semantic Search**: Similarity-based medicine matching
- **Fallback**: PubMed retriever for comprehensive coverage

#### Language Models
- **Primary LLM**: GPT-4o for high-quality text generation
- **Grammar Correction**: Gramformer for input preprocessing
- **Embeddings**: HuggingFace sentence transformers

#### Memory & Context
- **Conversation Buffer**: Maintains chat history
- **Context Awareness**: Personalized recommendations
- **State Management**: Seamless user experience
